Currently, each record in the table corresponds to a candidate's votes for each county for each vote mode. You need to reformat the table so that each record corresponds to a single county for each election year, with fields showing the total votes for each major party candidate for that election year in that county. It is possible to do this using the Pivot Table geoprocessing tool or Excel pivot tables, but Python may make it easier to automate and share.\n","\n","The steps in restructuring the table are as follows:\n","\n","Limit records to only candidates who identify as either a Democrat or a Republican\n","Sum each candidate's votes for every mode in each county, for each election year\n","Lock some fields in place, and then pivot the table using the party field.\n","Reformat the pivoted table."],"metadata":{"id":"wHz_kE8wYVM1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Filter records by political identity for Democrats and Republicans.\n","election_df = election_df.query(\"Pol_identity in ['DEMOCRAT', 'REPUBLICAN']\")\n","election_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":652},"id":"5z3c0FveYV4j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725443471695,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":424,"user":{"displayName":"Marvin Sakali","userId":"00195166102621251257"}},"outputId":"8bd197bc-36b9-4a25-bc8b-f20e2fcf1943"},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       year    state state_abbr county_name   FIPS        office  \\\n","0      2000  ALABAMA         AL     AUTAUGA  01001  US PRESIDENT   \n","1      2000  ALABAMA         AL     AUTAUGA  01001  US PRESIDENT   \n","4      2000  ALABAMA         AL     BALDWIN  01003  US PRESIDENT   \n","5      2000  ALABAMA         AL     BALDWIN  01003  US PRESIDENT   \n","8      2000  ALABAMA         AL     BARBOUR  01005  US PRESIDENT   \n","...     ...      ...        ...         ...    ...           ...   \n","72608  2020  WYOMING         WY       UINTA  56041  US PRESIDENT   \n","72609  2020  WYOMING         WY    WASHAKIE  56043  US PRESIDENT   \n","72612  2020  WYOMING         WY    WASHAKIE  56043  US PRESIDENT   \n","72613  2020  WYOMING         WY      WESTON  56045  US PRESIDENT   \n","72616  2020  WYOMING         WY      WESTON  56045  US PRESIDENT   \n","\n","               candidate Pol_identity  candidatevotes  totalvotes   version  \\\n","0                AL GORE     DEMOCRAT            4942       17208  20220315   \n","1         GEORGE W.
